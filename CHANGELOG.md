# Changelog

All notable changes to BirdStation are documented here.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-06

### Bird Flow — Live Pipeline Dashboard
- **New landing page** (`dashboard.html`) showing the detection pipeline in real-time
- Flow corridor layout: Mic → Engine → Detection with animated pulse connectors
- **Live audio levels** via SSE `/api/audio/monitor` with breathing glow
- **Dual AI cores** — BirdNET (blue) + Perch V2 (teal) with distinct visual identity
  - Per-model species name + confidence updated live from SSE logs
  - Consensus/divergence indicator when both models detect
- **Pipeline stages** — 4-stage animated flow (Listen → Record → Analyze → Store)
  with progress bar driven by real backend events
- **Latest detection card** with 130px photo, confidence ring, entrance animation
- **Recent species strip** — today's top 8 species with thumbnails
- **Key events feed** — curated from SSE logs, humanized messages
  - BirdWeather events show species + confidence
  - Technical log messages translated to readable French/English
- **KPIs** — detections today, unique species, review queue, system health
- **System status panel** — backlog, lag, sensitivity, recording length
- index.html now redirects to dashboard.html

### UX/UI Audit & Navigation Overhaul
- **6 navigation sections** (was 5): Home, Live, History, Species, Indicators, Station
- **22 pages in nav** (was 18): reintegrated recent, models, recordings (were orphaned)
- **Mobile drawer** — hamburger button opens bottom sheet with all sections/pages
- **Fixed 5 missing NAV_KEYS** — overview, calendar, favorites, weather, log were showing raw key names
- **Fixed mobile nav labels** — weather.html was labeled "Analyses" instead of "Météo"
- **Differentiated nav_timeline/nav_calendar** — were both "Calendrier" in French
- **Homogenized 9 page titles** — 9 English `<title>` tags translated to French
- **Cross-navigation** between settings and system pages (link tabs)

### Bug Fixes
- **Rate limiting** — reduced dashboard polling from ~18 to ~8 req/min, debounced SSE-triggered refreshes
- **Perch V2 inference time** — regex was case-sensitive, never matched lowercase `perch_v2`
- **SSE log categorization** — API messages (`GET /api/flagged-detections`) were miscategorized as "detection"
- **Vue reactivity** — `Object.assign` instead of full ref replacement prevents data flickering
- **Species persistence** — model cards keep last detected species (dimmed) instead of clearing every 45s

### i18n
- 60+ new translation keys across FR/EN/DE/NL for dashboard, events, model status, navigation

## [1.0.1] — 2026-04-05

### Architecture
- **Server modularization** — server.js split from 5759 to 208 lines (-96%)
  - 11 route modules in `server/routes/` (audio, backup, data, detections, external, photos, settings, system, timeline, whats-new)
  - 3 library modules in `server/lib/` (alerts, config, db)
  - Route modules use `handle(req, res, pathname, ctx)` pattern with dependency injection
- All 141 tests pass unchanged

### Performance
- **i18n extraction** — translations moved from inline JS to `/i18n/*.json` (4 files, loaded async)
  - `bird-vue-core.js`: 218 KB → 62 KB (-72%)
  - Pages await `BIRDASH.ready` before mounting
- **SW cache v100** — precache updated with i18n files

### Code quality
- **`useAudioPlayer()` composable** — shared audio player with rAF progress, seeking, optional Web Audio filters
  - Migrated calendar, recent, today pages — removes ~150 lines of duplicated code
- **Lazy-loaded settings tabs** — settings.html split into 9 tab fragments (2872→1594 lines, -45%)
  - Tabs loaded on first activation via `defineAsyncComponent` + fetch
  - `provide`/`inject` shares reactive state, `keep-alive` caches DOM
- **SEC-05** — Service Worker registration errors now logged instead of silently swallowed

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-04

First public release. Complete bird detection dashboard for Raspberry Pi.

### Dashboard (15 pages)

**New pages**
- **Calendar** — unified day-by-day view merging timeline + species list + audio player
- **Weather** — dedicated weather/activity correlation page with Pearson r, tomorrow's forecast, species by conditions
- **Log live** — real-time streaming log dashboard (SSE) with color-coded categories, filters, KPIs
- **Favorites** — dedicated page with KPIs, search, sort; heart toggle on all species lists

**Timeline (full-page)**
- Drag-to-zoom on density bar and sky canvas (infinite zoom, min 15 minutes)
- Unified bird density slider (0-100%) replacing separate controls
- SVG sunrise/sunset icons, emoji moon phases with illumination %
- Filter badges with count + blink highlight (10 pulses, opacity only)
- Clusters always expanded into individual markers (no more three-dot bubbles)
- Labels repositioned for high-confidence birds near top
- Zoom preserved when changing density slider
- No flash/spinner when changing slider

**Review**
- Full spectrogram modal with gain/highpass/lowpass filters and loop selection
- Select + delete permanently (DB + audio files) with preview modal and result report
- Purge all rejected with preview
- Badge counter in nav showing pending review count

**Species**
- Favorites system (SQLite-backed with API)
- Personal notes per species and per detection (SQLite)
- Phenology calendar (12-month dot map)
- Year-over-year monthly comparison chart
- Chart PNG export on all 5 charts
- Web Share API with HTTP fallback
- "Deep analysis" link to analyses page
- Swipe gestures on photo carousel

**Today**

### Navigation restructured
- 5 intent-based sections: Live, History, Species, Insights, Station

- Notification bell with unseen count from /api/whats-new
- Review badge counter

### Architecture
- DSP code consolidated into bird-shared.js (-765 lines from 6 HTML files)
- Timeline rendering extracted to bird-timeline.js
- index.html reduced from 72KB to 56KB
- Favorites and notes migrated from localStorage to SQLite with API
- localStorage keys normalized to underscore format with auto-migration
- Service worker cache versioning (v1 → v92)

### Bug fixes
- SRI integrity on Vue CDN (index/timeline)
- authHeaders() in BirdImg (was ReferenceError)
- buildAudioUrl: encode all path segments (accents caused 404s)
- UTC→localDateStr for timeline dates
- Review page: apiBase→apiUrl (was undefined, page completely broken)
- Review badge: total now counts flagged items, not pre-filter rows
- firstday/nocturnal/best/firstyear events no longer absorbed by clusters (priority 1)
- "See this day" routes to calendar for past dates, today for current
- Share button works on HTTP (fallback to execCommand/prompt)
- sessionStorage cleanup: no more mutation during iteration
- onclick removed from safeHtml whitelist (XSS prevention)
- BIRDWEATHER_ID redacted from /api/settings response
- loadFavorites race condition fixed with promise lock
- navSectionClick no longer auto-navigates to first page

### i18n

- OG meta tags on all 18 HTML pages

### Documentation

- All screenshots section restructured by navigation sections
