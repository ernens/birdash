### Architecture
- DSP code consolidated into bird-shared.js (-765 lines from 6 HTML files)
- Timeline rendering extracted to bird-timeline.js
- index.html reduced from 72KB to 56KB

### Bug fixes
- SRI integrity on Vue CDN (index/timeline)
- authHeaders() in BirdImg (was ReferenceError)
- buildAudioUrl: encode all path segments (accents caused 404s)
- UTC→localDateStr for timeline dates
- Review page: apiBase→apiUrl (was undefined, page completely broken)
- Review badge: total now counts flagged items, not pre-filter rows
- firstday/nocturnal/best/firstyear events no longer absorbed by clusters (priority 1)
- "See this day" routes to calendar for past dates, today for current
- Share button works on HTTP (fallback to execCommand/prompt)
- sessionStorage cleanup: no more mutation during iteration
- onclick removed from safeHtml whitelist (XSS prevention)

- loadFavorites race condition fixed with promise lock
- navSectionClick no longer auto-navigates to first page

### i18n
